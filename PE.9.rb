A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a<b<c, for which 
a ** 2 + b ** 2 = c ** 2. 
For example, 3, 4, and 5. 

There exists only one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000. 
Find the product abc.

# If (a, b, c) is a pythagorean triplet, then so is (ka, kb, kc) for any k. Therefore, 
# if we find a triplet such that a + b + c = 100, then the triplet (10a, 10b, 10c) is
# our solution.
